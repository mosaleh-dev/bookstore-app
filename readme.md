# Bookstore App ðŸ“š

A Node.js application for managing books, featuring user authentication, CRUD operations for books, cover image uploads, and role-based access control.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login using JWT.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiates between `user` and `admin` roles, with admins having extended privileges (e.g., deleting any book).
- **Book Management (CRUD)**:
  - Users can create, read, and update their own books.
  - Admins can read all books and delete any book.
- **Cover Image Uploads**: Users can upload cover images for books, which are stored locally.
- **Input Validation**: Robust validation for user registration, login, and book data.
- **Comprehensive API Testing**: Includes integration tests using Vitest and Supertest.
- **Interactive UI**: A basic `index.html` is provided for interacting with the API directly from the browser.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcryptjs for password hashing
- **File Uploads**: Multer (for local storage)
- **Request Logging**: Morgan
- **Input Validation**: `express-validator`
- **Testing**: Vitest, Supertest
- **Environment Management**: `dotenv`

## Data Flow: Create Book with Image

This sequence diagram shows the data flow when a user creates a new book with a cover image.

    participant Client
    participant ExpressApp as "app.js"
    participant BookRoutes as "bookRoutes.js"
    participant AuthMiddleware as "authMiddleware"
    participant Multer as "Multer Middleware"
    participant Validation as "Validation Middleware"
    participant BookController as "bookController.js"
    participant BookService as "bookService.js"

```

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mosaleh-dev/bookstore-app.git
    cd bookstore-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables. Replace placeholder values with your actual configuration.

    ```env
    # MongoDB Connection URI
    MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<your-cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

    # JWT Secret for signing tokens
    JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key_here"

    # (Optional) JWT Token Expiration Time (e.g., 1h, 7d)
    # JWT_EXPIRES_IN="1h"

    # (Optional) Port for the application
    # PORT=3000
    ```

    **Important**: Ensure your `MONGODB_URI` points to your MongoDB instance and `JWT_SECRET` is a strong, unique secret.

4.  **Ensure `uploads` directory exists**:
    The application will attempt to create an `uploads` directory in the project root if it doesn't exist. This directory is used for storing book cover images.

## Scripts

- **Start the application in development mode** (with Nodemon for auto-restarts):

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  The server will typically start on `http://localhost:3000`.

- **Start the application in production mode**:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **Run tests**:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
  This will execute the integration tests using Vitest. Test coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory.

## API Endpoints

(A brief overview, refer to `routes/` and `app.test.js` for details)

### Authentication (`/auth`)

- `POST /register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /login`: Log in an existing user, returns a JWT.

### Books (`/books`)

_Requires authentication (JWT in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`)._

- `POST /`: Create a new book. (Image upload via `coverImage` field in FormData)
- `GET /`: Get books.
  - Regular users: Get their own books.
  - Admin users: Get all books.
- `GET /:id`: Get a specific book by ID.
  - Users can only get their own books.
  - Admins can get any book.
- `PUT /:id`: Update a book by ID. (Image update/removal via `coverImage` field)
  - Users can only update their own books.
  - Admins can update any book.
- `DELETE /:id`: Delete a book by ID.
  - **Admin only**.

## Testing the API

- **Automated Tests**: Run `npm test` to execute the Vitest integration tests. These cover various scenarios including authentication, CRUD operations, role permissions, and file uploads.
- **Manual Testing (UI)**: Open `index.html` in your browser. This simple UI allows you to register, log in, and perform book management operations by interacting directly with the API. Ensure the API server (`npm run dev` or `npm start`) is running.
